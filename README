Python re-implementation of a program which uses libvirt to copy virtual 
machines between two servers. Designed to be run at a reasonable interval, 
it keeps a backup mirror of a virtual machine on another physical server.

Note, this software is extremely incomplete. See the 'twin' project for a
complete and working solution in bash.
